- Function "generate_1d_matrix" randomly generates 1D vector
- Function "generate_3d_matrix" randomly generates 3D vector
- Function "convert_3d_to_1d" converts 3D vector to 1D
- Function "convert_1d_to_3d" converts 1D vector to 3D


## How to run the program correctly 
- Install python (in case it was not installed)
